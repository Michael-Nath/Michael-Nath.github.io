I'm announcing this as a brief announcement, but possibly an inflection point, about my life. This upcoming summer I am set to conduct research in the realm
of robotics, deep reinforcement learning, and computer vision! I will be a part of the Stanford SVL lab, mentored by [Stephen Tian](https://s-tian.github.io) and working in [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/#home)'s research group within SVL.
