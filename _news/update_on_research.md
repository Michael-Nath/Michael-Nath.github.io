title: I'm thinking of pursuing research long term.

This summer, I've come to realize that research **has** to be a core part of my life. I have been
thoroughly enjoying my summer at SVL — the kinds of minds I am around, the questions
I get to tackle each day, and even the most frustrating of software bugs — make each day so fun.
As much theory and science as there is, there is also a great deal of engineering that I get to lead,
so effectively I get to learn and grow in both domains. In the coming school year, I hope to dive deep in my research.
This summer has already helped me become a better scientist, and I can't wait for what my future projects have in store for me.
