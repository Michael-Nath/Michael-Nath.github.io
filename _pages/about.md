Welcome! I'm Michael, a sophomore at Stanford studying mathematics and computer science. I hope this personal site
gives you a thorough overview of my work, ideas, and reflections. If there's anything you'd like to chat about with me — whether
at a coffee shop or virtually — feel free to reach out!
