Welcome! I'm Michael, a rising junior at Stanford on the CS Systems track. To that end, I am interested in distributed operating systems & fast machine learning.

My core research interest lies in general robot intelligence, which I pursue as an undergraduate researcher at the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab under [Stephen Tian](https://s-tian.github.io) (mentor) and [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com) (supervisor). I possess strong engineering/research experience with deep reinforcement learning / computer vision, generative models, graph neural networks, intuitive physics models, and robot physics engines.

I hope this personal site gives you a overview of my work, ideas, and reflections. If there's anything you'd like to chat about with me — whether at a coffee shop or virtually — feel free to reach out!
