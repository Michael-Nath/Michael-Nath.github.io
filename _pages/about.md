I want robots to work in the wild - like in jungles, the surface of Saturn's Titan, and my bathroom.
Check out `interests` for more on that.

- Stanford CS, concentrated in systems & ai.
- Working on edge inference at Stanford Hazy.
- learning the piano (hoping to play some Pok√©mon battle music)
- avid ping ponger
- philosphical fiction enthusiast (Crime and Punishment favorite so far)
