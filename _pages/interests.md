> My mission in life is to work alongside brilliant scientists everyday, inventing innovations to incredibly hard problems, propelling humanity to unimaginable realms.
> This is the dream that contextualizes my psyche, and is ultimately my chief interest in our world.

## Research
I wish to become an excellent scientist. I believe there's nothing more profound, not just by its nature but also its very implications, than unearthing insights about the world we live in.
I want the world to have *everyday robots*, robust metal companions that augment our day-to-day activities, but also eliminate its annoyances. Therefore, I wish to discover as much about artificial
general intelligence, and this is the science that I'm in love with. In particular, I am deeply interested in the intersection of **reinforcement learning** and **human-robotic interaction**. Research questions that I would
have thought about include:

- *How can reinforcement learning empower multimodal robotic agents in everyday tasks such as pathfinding, manipulation, and vision?*
- *How can we leverage game theory to get robots with different objectives to "get along" with one another?*

My vision of the "everyday robot" spans the gamut of hardware size and domain. It includes brain-computer-interfaces, warehouse robots, drones, etc. The future of robotics is sky-blue, and I want to be a part of every
bit of it.

## Engineering
I believe programming is the key to building out the science of tomorrow. With the sheer amount of compute power, systems optimizations, and data available, we can engineer incredibly
powerful systems. I am particularly interested in computer systems (networking & concurrency) and I hope to become a very strong systems programmer. I especially hope to become excellent at translating intricate theory into efficient algorithms that scale. 

## Personal
I want to have timeless conversations with people. All of my top memories have included neverending laughter, immense vulnerability, and ever-relevant insights. If there's any "success metric" I believe in, it's that: how kind am I to those around me? How meaningful are the conversations?
