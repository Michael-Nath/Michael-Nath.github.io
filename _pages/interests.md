> This is the dream that contextualizes my psyche, and is ultimately my chief interest in our world.

## Research

I wish to become an excellent scientist. I believe there's nothing more profound, not just by its nature but also its very implications, than unearthing insights about the world we live in.
I want the world to have *everyday robots*, robust metal companions that augment our day-to-day activities, but also eliminate its annoyances. Therefore, I wish to discover as much about artificial
general intelligence, and this is the science that I'm in love with. My vision of the "everyday robot" spans the gamut of hardware size and domain. It includes brain-computer-interfaces, warehouse robots, drones, etc. The future of robotics is sky-blue, and I want to be a part of every
bit of it.

## Engineering

I believe programming is the key to building out the science of tomorrow. With the sheer amount of compute power, systems optimizations, and data available, we can engineer incredibly
powerful systems. I am particularly interested in computer systems and I hope to become a strong systems programmer. I especially hope to become excellent at translating intricate theory into efficient algorithms that scale.

## Personal

I want to have timeless conversations with people. All of my top memories have included neverending laughter, immense vulnerability, and ever-relevant insights. If there's any "success metric" I believe in, it's that: how kind am I to those around me? How meaningful are the conversations?
