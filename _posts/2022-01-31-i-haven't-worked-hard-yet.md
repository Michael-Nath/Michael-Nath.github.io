My ancestors have likely had to wrestle with wild animals to protect their tribes/family from meeting extinction. My ancestors have likely had to endure days of immense fatigue, starvation, hopelessness. But my ancestors lived on and while most of it might have been them being at the right place at the right time, a lot of it boiled down to truly working hard. My father is another example of someone who truly works hard. Even if its really early in the morning, he makes sure to get to work. He rarely takes days off and I’m sure he puts a lot of thought when he’s at work. My mom works really hard too, cooking meals for everyone while also working at the local pastry shop. They’ve worked so hard, in fact, that they’ve managed to gather a handful of illnesses and injuries. Yet they still move… they still move… 

I seriously don’t think I’ve worked hard recently, and let me clarify what I mean by working hard. I don’t mean grinding away on psets, or running a dozen miles everyday. By working hard, I mean taking a dream that you have, and putting everything you’ve got and more to realizing the f*** out of that dream. I can only recall one thing that I’ve poured my heart, soul, and sweat into, and that was getting into Stuy. I vividly recall the amount of time I spent on the homeworks, going to the practice sessions, doing afterschool programs, purchasing and completing workbooks, watching a ton of videos online. I knew that I had to get into that school, and everyday getitng into Stuy was in the core of my mind. That was the dream that middle school Michael Nath had, and that was the dream that he had indeed realized. And wow, come to think of it, the amount of joy I felt that day was unmeasurable. And I want to feel that again.

So what’s stopping me from working hard like that. Well for one, the Michael Nath that worked hard truly focused on getting into Stuy. I think there are a lot of distractions at Stanford, including even classes at times. I remember reading about Andrej’s [advice](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html) that really you should strive to get good-ish grades. It’s obviously nice to cop an A, but if getting that A requires you to give up doing what you know you have to do to realize your dreams, then drop it.
